# Lab Exercise 3

Create a multi-page application that allows a user to select one of two degree programs: IST and APT
Once a degree program is selected, the results page should show 10 courses offered by that program
The multi-page application should have two pages: the page that allows the user to select the degree program, and a results page that shows 10 courses.
The courses do not need to be fetched from a database â€“ they can just be hard-coded somewhere to facilitate easy testing.
