# Ensemble

A group of predictors is called an Ensemble thus this technique of having a group of predictors such as classifiers or regressors is Ensemble Learning and an Ensemble Learning algorithm is called an Ensemble method

## Ensemble Learning with Multiple Decision Trees (A.K.A Random Forest)
To implement Ensemble Learning, we can use multiple decision trees. How do we do this? We get a group of decision tree classifiers and train each on different random subsets of the training set. Once we get the predictions, we get the aggregate of this predictions from each individual tree then predict the class that gets the most votes.
Such an Ensemble of Decision Trees is called a Random Forest and despite its simplicity, it is one of the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available today.

## Random Forest

## Soft Voting

## Hard Voting

## Bagging and Pasting
Bagging is with Replacement while pasting is not with replacement

## Boosting
