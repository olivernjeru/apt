# Setting up Android Studio

## Making sure Java is installed
In cmd, type in the command:

`javac`

If a list of information is displayed, Java is installed, if an error shows up, it is not installed.

## Running a Java file
Pre-requisite, Java files and classes are case sensitive, if a class begins with a letter in upper case, the file name must begin with an upper case letter.

To run the file, located the file and type in the command:

`javac <filename.java>`

This will create an object file with the same name as the file before, filename.class

To run the object file, type the following command:

`javac <filename`
