    <p>The picture in page 2 is one I took of a friend of mine, Shaina, at an Endowment Dinner event meant to raise funds for Scholarships and Financial Aid that go towards underfunded and underrepresented students. The Idea behind the photo was luxury and elegance. Since it was a dinner, everyone was dressed to impress and I saw my chance to create something beautiful out of it and I took it!</p>
