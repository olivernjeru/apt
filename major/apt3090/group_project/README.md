# APT 3090: Cryptography & Network Security — Group Project

Led a 5-person team delivering multiple security exercises end-to-end: planning, design, implementation, documentation, and presentation.

## Components

- RSA implementation over TCP — client/server key exchange and message encryption
- SSL activity — explore TLS/SSL concepts and secure channels
- Credit Card Vault — simple vault patterns and secure handling exercises

## Architecture

- q1-rsa-implementation-over-tcp
  - Python sockets (server/client) with modular RSA utils
  - Key generation, exchange, and message encryption/decryption flows
- q2-credit-card-vault
  - Python modules for storage and simple crypto routines, images for docs
- ssl_activity
  - Exercises to understand SSL/TLS trust, certificates, and channel security

## Team and Role

- Team size: 5
- Role: Team Lead — product/technical direction, task allocation, code reviews, integration, and final presentation

## Structure

- q1-rsa-implementation-over-tcp/
