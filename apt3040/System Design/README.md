* Notes
    * UML Xtics
        <ul>Has diagrams used for analysis and design</ul>
        <ul>doesnâ€™t include a software process</ul>
        <ul>supports inheritance, whole part, association, aggregation, composition</ul>
        <ul>UML design models can be implemented in any programming language or platform</ul>
    * Advantages
        <ul>Software reuse</ul>
        <ul>Flexibility due to polymorphism</ul>
        <ul>Security due to information hiding</ul>
        <ul>Easy maintenance due to modularity</ul>
    * Disadvantages
        <ul>Step Learning curve</ul>
        <ul>Cannot be used to solve all problems</ul>
        <ul>Slow execution due to message passing and larger programs</ul>
    * Activity Diagrams
        <ul>Has start and end symbol</ul>
        <ul>Has activity/action</ul>
        <ul>Has note/comment symbol</ul>
    * UML Full Class Diagrams
        <ul>Has three partitions:</ul>
            * Name
            * Attributes
            * Methods
    * Use Case Diagrams
        <ul>Has subsystem name</ul>
        <ul>Has actor name</ul>
        <ul>Has use case name</ul>
        <ul>Has association name</ul>

* A Successful Scenario for borrowing a book at the library
    <p>User goes to the Library</p>
    <p>Library is Open</p>
    <p>User goes to shelf to get book</p>
    <p>User picks book</p>
    <p>User gives book to librarian</p>
    <p>Librarian records book record update</p>
    <p>Librarian gives book to the user</p>
