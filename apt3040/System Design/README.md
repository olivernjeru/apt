# System Design

* Aggregation
    * Aggregation is a specialised form of association that defines a one-way relationship which specifies a 'has-a' relationship between two classes. An example of this you can say is a wallet has money. However, the money does not need a wallet in order to exist, so the relationship is one-way.The image below is an illustration of Aggregation in a UML Class Diagram

* Notes
    * UML Xtics
        <ul>Has diagrams used for analysis and design</ul>
        <ul>doesnâ€™t include a software process</ul>
        <ul>supports inheritance, whole part, association, aggregation, composition</ul>
        <ul>UML design models can be implemented in any programming language or platform</ul>
    * Advantages
        <ul>Software reuse</ul>
        <ul>Flexibility due to polymorphism</ul>
        <ul>Security due to information hiding</ul>
        <ul>Easy maintenance due to modularity</ul>
    * Disadvantages
        <ul>Step Learning curve</ul>
        <ul>Cannot be used to solve all problems</ul>
        <ul>Slow execution due to message passing and larger programs</ul>
    * Activity Diagrams
        <ul>Has start and end symbol</ul>
        <ul>Has activity/action</ul>
        <ul>Has note/comment symbol</ul>
    * UML Full Class Diagrams
        <p>Has three partitions:</p>
            <ul>Name</ul>
            <ul>Attributes</ul>
            <ul>Methods</ul>
    * Use Case Diagrams
        <ul>Has subsystem name</ul>
        <ul>Has actor name</ul>
        <ul>Has use case name</ul>
        <ul>Has association name</ul>

* A Successful Scenario for borrowing a book at the library
    * User goes to the Library
    * Library is Open
    * User goes to shelf to get book
    * User picks book
    * User gives book to librarian
    * Librarian records book record update
    * Librarian gives book to the user
